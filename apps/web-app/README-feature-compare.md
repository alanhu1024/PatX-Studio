### 3. Comparison File Management
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT format files
- **Manual Addition**: Can manually input comparison file names
- **Dynamic Management**: Add or remove comparison files at any time

### 4. Feature Analysis
- **AI Analysis**: Uses AI models to intelligently analyze selected features
- **Batch Processing**: Supports batch analysis of multiple features
- **Progress Display**: Real-time display of analysis progress
- **Result Application**: Analysis results automatically update to the table

### 5. Response Point Generation
- **Intelligent Generation**: Generates response opinions based on feature analysis results
- **Type Selection**: Supports creative response, novelty response, and other types
- **Batch Generation**: Can generate response points for multiple features simultaneously

### 6. Feature Detail Panel
